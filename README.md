# Shiva Chauhan
Medical Student | Healthcare Systems & Decision Architecture

I design decision and coordination systems for complex healthcare
environments, particularly where assumptions are fragile, failure is
costly, and execution happens under constraint.

My work treats healthcare breakdowns as system-design problems before
technical ones. I frame problems by defining assumptions, enforcing
safety boundaries, identifying failure modes, and deciding what should
not be built — before deciding what survives.

## Skills & Methods
Systems framing and governance, healthcare workflow design,
assumption and failure-mode analysis, supervisory system design,
Python-based prototyping and scripting, rule-based software workflows,
Mermaid diagrams and technical documentation, CAD modeling (TinkerCAD),
Arduino-based electrical prototyping and sensor–actuator integration

## What I Actually Do

- Frame ambiguous clinical and operational problems into explicit
  decision structures
- Define system scope, assumptions, and termination criteria
- Design end-to-end healthcare workflows before implementation
- Evaluate when technology (including ML) adds value — and when it does not
- Preserve auditability, governance, and failure literacy in system design

## What This Work Produces

My work typically resolves into a **constrained prototype**, **decision
diagram**, or **executable workflow** — not a finished product.

The goal is to build the smallest artifact that can fail meaningfully,
not the largest system that appears impressive.

## Hackathon Operating Mode

In rapid-build environments, I operate as a **system-framing and execution
accelerator**:

- Reduce problem scope aggressively
- Lock assumptions early
- Cut features to preserve decision clarity
- Build the smallest artifact that can be tested or invalidated within
  tight time constraints

## Why This GitHub Exists

This GitHub is not a product portfolio.

It is a **decision ledger**: a public record of how I frame problems,
bound scope, reason about failure, and convert uncertainty into
actionable, testable system artifacts.

Some repositories are exploratory.
Some are formally archived.
None claim clinical outcomes.
